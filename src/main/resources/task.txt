Test weather service / data

1.      Using API verify if days in given range are in valid temperature days (example: from day 5. to day 25.)
2.      Valid range is within max 25 degrees and min 21.5 degrees
3.      Temperature outside of valid range = fail
4.      Report temperatures in two different files, one for valid temperatures and one for invalid temperatures
5.      Log test execution steps
6.      Report on Passed / failed tests, list of days and number of days outside of valid temperature range, average temperature in given range
7.      Data of max, min temperature with days, temperature ordered data, temperatures days in reverse order (this point is optional)

Deliverables:
1.      Source code
2.      Proof of execution
3.      Instructions how to execute the test

Possible data Sources:
·         Any open weather service
·         https://rem-rest-api.herokuapp.com with self populated data
